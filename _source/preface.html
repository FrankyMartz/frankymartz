        <h1>Preface</h1>
        <p>
          I find myself more fascinated in redesigning this website than crafting
          articles to supplement it. An ironic coincidence, considering web design
          is all about the content.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love writing. The process of crafting statements,
          discussing philosophies, and offering opinions is nothing less than
          enjoyable. I simply can not deny the rush that precedes and succeeds a
          completed project (i.e. it feels great).
        </p>

        <p>
          That said, from this point forward I plan on extending this site both
          vertically and horizontally; So, expect both.
        </p>

        <p>Adventures guaranteed.</p>
